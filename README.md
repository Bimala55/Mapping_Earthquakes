# Mapping_Earthquakes
The project involves using JavaScript and APIs to visually tell a story about earthquakes around the world.The map contained the earthquake data represented as circular markers with their size and color corresponding to the magnitude of the earthquake. Each marker also has a popup that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake. The map also contains multiple viewing layers (i.e. satellite, street and dark) and the ability to toggle visibility of the earthquake data.
we use folowing software:
- MapBox APIs
- Leaflet
- D3
